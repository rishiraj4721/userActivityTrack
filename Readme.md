# User Activity Tracking 
## _By Rishi Raj_

This JavaScript library can be used to track user interaction on a webiste or webpage. This library tracks HTML button and anchor tag clicks by default. the user can also add more HTML tags or div elemenst by ID for tracking. 

## Features

- Track user interactions with webpage tags and elements
- Saves user session data and activity to MySQL database
- Identifies user using stored cookies
- Easy to add to webpages
- Easy to include more HTML tags and elements
- No visible performance decrease in loading and unloading webpages


## Tech

This tracking library uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
- [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
- [Gulp] - the streaming build system
- [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML
to Markdown converter
- [jQuery] - duh

And of course library itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

## Installation

Include the following snippet of code at the end of a webpage to be tracked.

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/analytics/dist/analytics.min.js"></script>
<script src="path_to_track.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
    const Analytics = _analytics.init({
        app: 'interactor',
        version: 1,
        plugins: [
            pluginTwo
        ]
    })
    Analytics.page(interactor)
    var user = Analytics.plugins.actionTrack.cookieBanner()
    var interactor = new Interactor({
        interactions: true,
        interactionElementTag: [],
        interactionElementId: [],
        interactionEvents: ['mouseup'],
        endpoint: './../submit3.php',
        async: true,
        debug: true,
        userid: user
    });
    
    /* Track a page view */
    Analytics.identify(user)
    Analytics.plugins.actionTrack.getstate(interactor)
</script>
```

For tracking more HTML tags...

```sh
interactionElementTag: ["list","of","desired","tags"]
```
For tracking elements by class ID...

```sh
interactionElementID: ["list","of","desired","element","IDs"]
```

## Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantaneously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:

```sh
node app
```

Second Tab:

```sh
gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:

```sh
karma test
```

#### Building for source

For production release:

```sh
gulp build --prod
```

Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:

```sh
gulp build dist --prod
```

## Docker

Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the
Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to
build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```

This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies.
Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual
version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on
your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to
port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart=always --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --name=dillinger <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

> Note: `--capt-add=SYS-ADMIN` is required for PDF rendering.

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in
your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```
